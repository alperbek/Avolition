The original Avolition release was shipped with a nude-patch,
so to keep the spirit of the original the 2.0 version also has one.

To enable this mod edit the config.ini 
Add the name of this folder (nude), after a comma and a space, at the end of the loadorder variable
under the [datafiles] section. It should look something like this:

[datafiles]
loadorder = core, user, nude
